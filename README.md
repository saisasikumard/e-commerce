# e-commerce
This project is an eCommerce website designed using a microservices architecture. The system is built with Java and Spring Boot, following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to ensure clean separation of concerns and maintainability. Each microservice is responsible for a specific domain of the application, allowing for scalability and independent development.
